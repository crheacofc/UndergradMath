    "Methods for calculating derivative values and integral values come in many flavors. Some approximations are faster than others even though they may not give as good of an error. Thus, it is important to measure the cost vs. accuracy for numerical methods and weigh one against the other. In the methods section each method for calculating the derivative and integral is briefly discussed; if the method is more detailed then a concise algorithm is included. In the results section there is a brief demonstration of how well the different approximations work."
